<h1>ARRANGEMENT OF CARDS IN THE PUBLIC CATALOGUE</h1>
<p>
Although cards are filed in the catalogue alphabetically by author, subject, and sometimes title, the large number of entries makes it necessary to have a filing system. 
A copy of Princeton University Library Filing Rules is kept on the counter next to the Public Catalogue. Some of these rules are given below.
</p>

<p>
1. Arrangement is word by word, alphabetizing letter by letter to the end of each word.
    <ul>
        <li> New England</li>
        <li> New York</li>
        <li> Newark</li>
        <li> Newman</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
2. Order of entries under same word. When the same word is used for several kinds of headings, it is arranged in the flowing order: person, place, thing, title.
    <ul>
        <li>Maine, Sir Henry J.S. (person)</li>
        <li>Maine. Legislative (place)</li>
        <li>MAINE-MAPS (place)</li>
        <li>Maine, University (place)</li>
