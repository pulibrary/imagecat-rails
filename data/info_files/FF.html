Use of the sub-heading Manuscripts ceased in 1968.
<p>
This file includes all entries made through 1967 for manuscripts of the Bible or of its parts, regardless of language.  Similar works cataloged after that date are treated as editions and filed by part or language.
<p>
Entries for individual texts of Bible manuscripts, and works about those specific texts, are arranged by language and then by designation or part.  Subject entries about Bible manuscripts in general follow all such entries for texts.
