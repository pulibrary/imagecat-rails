Because the United States file is so long, special headers are provided to indicate major file divisions.
<p>
A relatively small group of United States entries without subdivision (i.e., headings for the United States as a corporate or geographic entity) are at the beginning of the file.
<p>
United States entries with corporate or subject subdivisions are grouped into 10 major subfiles.  The subfiles for Congress and History contain all subdivisions beginning with those specific terms.  Others contain a range of subdivisions, as indicated.  To find United States headings with a specific subheading, select the appropriate range.  The first level of subheadings are arranged alphabetically, with further subarrangement as indicated.
